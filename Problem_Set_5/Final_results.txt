-----------Part 1-------
The relaxation method took 1774 to converge to a precision of 0.05.
The value of lambda on the ring is given by 1.420664076756184e-09.
We can see qualitatively in "Part1_potential_relaxation.png" that this is very close to the anlytic potential .
However, since the analytic potential is a radial solution, it cannot meet the boundary condition of the box
This explanins why the "analytic" field is really weird when we simply take the gradient of the field given by the analytic formula.
Therefore, I would trust more the numerical solution since it actually solve for the good b.c
Furthermore, our numerical charge denisty is exaclty what we would expect, ie the charge is on the outside of the cylinder.

-----------Part 2-------
The relaxation method took 47 to converge to a precision of 0.05, which is way faster than what we had in one.
Resulting potential,field and chage distribution are shown in "Part2_Potential_conjugate_gradient.png".

-----------Part 3-------
The relaxation method took 22 to converge to a precision of 0.05, which is less than in Part 2.
The interpolation for scipy is relatively slow for large matrices so I am not sure if doing this this way
actually solves time... This could  although definitely be address and then it would save much time.
Resulting potential,field and chage distribution are shown in "Part3_field_resolution_increase.png".

-----------Part 4-------
The field near the bump is enormous compared to the rest of the field as it can be see in "Part4_Field_from_wire_with_bump.png".
Therefore, a  lot of power is radiated away because of the bump.
This explains why power companies do not want bumps in their wires.

-----------Part 5-------
Note that since we are only considering a slab in the middle and that all slab are the same, I solve the problem in 1D.
We have to define the following constants: dt,dx,k,x_max,t_max.
While x_max,t_max and C are simply a choice or would be fix by the problem,
the value of dt,dx and k decide of the stability of the solution. If k*dt/dx**2, the solution will converge.
