#Compute and plot the electric field of a spehrical shell as a function of r
#by considering a ring and integrating over the rings in the shell.
#The integral can be found in the solution of Griffith 2.7
#It is given by 1/(2*e0)*(R^2*sig) âˆ«du (z-Ru)/(R^2+z^2-2Rzu)^(3/2)
#We compare the results given by the adaptative simpson's rule and 
#scipy.integrate.quad.
#WARNING: Rquires python 3.6 or higher due to the use of f-strings
